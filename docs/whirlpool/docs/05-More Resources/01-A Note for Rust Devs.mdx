# A Note for Rust Developers

The tutorials presented in this portal are catered towards Typescript SDK users. We plan on releasing tutorials and guides for Rust developers in the future, but for now, please reference the following resources:

Many of the Typescript tutorials will still be helpful to help you understand the sequences of instruction needed to perform actions against the Whirlpool program. So please give them a read as well.
